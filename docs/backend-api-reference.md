# Backend API Reference

This document describes the HTTP API surface exposed by the frontend backend
(`src/app/api`). The routes are intentionally thin stubs in the current code
base; they exist primarily for analytics hooks and development/testing.

Each entry includes the HTTP method, path, expected request body (if any), and
an example response. All endpoints return JSON.

## CORS Summary

- Public browser routes return wildcard CORS without credentials.
- First-party browser routes echo only trusted Commitlabs origins and may allow
  credentials.
- Implemented routes answer `OPTIONS` preflight requests automatically.

See [docs/backend-cors-policy.md](./backend-cors-policy.md) for the full
origin configuration and route classification.

## Standard Response Conventions

All endpoints follow these conventions.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { ... }       // optional pagination / additional metadata
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "TOO_MANY_REQUESTS",
    "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
    "retryAfterSeconds": 60 // present on 429 and 503 only
  }
}
```

### Rate Limited Responses (429 / 503)

When a request is rate-limited, the response includes the `Retry-After` HTTP header:

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
```

| Status | `retryAfterSeconds` default | Meaning                         |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 429    | 60 s                        | Client exceeded rate limit      |
| 503    | 30 s                        | Service temporarily unavailable |

Clients should wait the indicated seconds before retrying. See [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md) for the full client retry strategy (exponential backoff + jitter).

## `POST /api/commitments/[id]/early-exit`

Executes an early exit from an active commitment. The caller must be authenticated
via session cookie and must own the commitment. The route validates the request body,
verifies ownership, and invokes the blockchain contract to process the early exit with
applicable penalties.

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Required**: Session cookie with valid authentication token.
- **Ownership Check**: The `callerAddress` in the request body must match:
  1. The authenticated user's address (from the session).
  2. The actual owner of the commitment on-chain.
- **Returns**:
  - `401 UNAUTHORIZED` if no valid session token.
  - `403 FORBIDDEN` if addresses do not match or caller does not own the commitment.

### Request

**Path parameter**: `id` (string) — The commitment ID to exit early.

**Headers**:
- `Idempotency-Key`: Optional. Replayed requests within the 24-hour replay window return the original prior result.
- `Cookie`: Required session cookie with valid token.
- `Content-Type`: `application/json`

**Body Schema** (validated via Zod):
```typescript
{
  reason: string; // Non-empty, max 500 characters (reason for early exit)
  callerAddress: string; // Valid 56-character Stellar public key
}
```

**Body Validation Errors**:

- `reason` missing or empty: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `reason` > 500 characters: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `callerAddress` missing: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `callerAddress` not a valid Stellar address: `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`

### Response

**Success (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "exitAmount": "950.00", // Amount returned to owner
    "penaltyAmount": "50.00", // Penalty deducted
    "finalStatus": "EARLY_EXIT", // Updated commitment status
    "txHash": "abc123...", // Transaction hash (if on-chain)
    "reference": null // Reference for mock mode
  },
  "meta": {
    "correlationId": "...",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Errors**:

| Status | Code                     | Meaning                                                                 |

Contract-service failures are normalized before they are returned, so clients always receive the standard `{ success: false, error: ... }` envelope with stable status codes.

**Error Response Example** (403 Forbidden):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "You do not own this commitment and cannot exit it early.",
    "correlationId": "...",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Example

**Request**:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/commitments/cm_123456/early-exit \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Cookie: session=valid-token-abc123' \
     -d '{
       "reason": "Need liquidity for unexpected investment",
       "callerAddress": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
     }'
```

**Success Response** (200):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "exitAmount": "950",
    "penaltyAmount": "50",
    "finalStatus": "EARLY_EXIT",
    "txHash": "abc123def456",
    "reference": null
  },
  "meta": {
    "correlationId": "xyz789",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Ownership Violation** (403):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "You do not own this commitment and cannot exit it early.",
    "correlationId": "xyz789",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Notes

- **Input Validation**: Request body is validated against `EarlyExitRequestBodySchema`
  (Zod) before processing.
- **Ownership Verification**: After authentication, the route fetches the commitment
  from chain and verifies the owner matches the authenticated caller.
- **Contract Interaction**: Calls `earlyExitCommitmentOnChain()` which:
  - Checks commitment status (must be ACTIVE, not SETTLED/VIOLATED/EARLY_EXIT).
  - Submits transaction to Soroban contract.
  - Returns penalty and exit amounts.
- **Error Mapping**: Contract errors are normalized via `normalizeBackendError()`
  to ensure consistent error codes and messages.
- **Rate Limiting**: All requests are subject to per-IP rate limiting
  (`api/commitments/early-exit`).

## `GET /api/attestations/recent`

Returns the most recent attestations sorted by `observedAt` descending, with
page-based pagination metadata.

- **Query parameters**:
    - `page`: (integer, optional) Page number (1-based). Must be ≥ 1. Defaults to 1.
    - `pageSize`: (integer, optional) Items per page. Must be 1–100. Defaults to 10.
    - `ownerAddress`: (string, optional) Filter by commitment owner address. Requires a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **Response**: `200 OK` with attestation list and pagination meta.
- **Error codes**:
    - `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` — `page` or `pageSize` out of range, or `ownerAddress` is blank.
    - `401 UNAUTHORIZED` — `ownerAddress` provided without a valid Bearer token.
    - `429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` — Rate limit exceeded.

### Example

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/attestations/recent?page=1&pageSize=2'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "attestations": [
      { "id": "ATT-005", "commitmentId": "CMT-005", "observedAt": "2026-04-24T10:00:00Z" },
      { "id": "ATT-004", "commitmentId": "CMT-004", "observedAt": "2026-04-23T10:00:00Z" }
    ],
    "total": 5
  },
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 2,
    "total": 5,
    "totalPages": 3,
    "hasNextPage": true,
    "hasPrevPage": false
  }
}
```

Filtered by owner (requires authentication):

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/attestations/recent?ownerAddress=GAAA...WHF' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

---

## `POST /api/attestations`

Records an attestation event. Stub implementation logs
`AttestationReceived`.

- **Request body**: JSON describing the attestation (e.g. signature,
  commitmentId).
- **Response**: stub message with requester IP.

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/attestations \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"commitmentId":"abc123","status":"valid"}'
```

```json
{
  "message": "Attestations recording endpoint stub - rate limiting applied",
  "ip": "::1"
}
```

---

## `GET /api/notifications`

Returns the authenticated owner's derived notification feed. Notifications are
derived on-read from the owner's commitments and attestations (expiry warnings,
violations, attestation health checks); they are not persisted.

The feed is filtered by the owner's **notification delivery preferences**. Each
notification has a `type` (`expiry`, `violation`, `health_check`), and only
types the owner has opted into are returned. Preferences are read from stored
user preferences (the `notificationCategories` field) and updated via the
`PUT /api/user/preferences` endpoint.

- **Query parameters**:
    - `ownerAddress`: (string, required) The Stellar address whose feed to return.
    - `page`: (number, optional, default `1`) 1-indexed page number. Must be `>= 1`.
    - `pageSize`: (number, optional, default `10`) Items per page. Must be `1`–`100`.
- **Preference filtering**:
    - Notification categories the owner has set to `false` in
      `notificationCategories` are excluded from the feed.
    - When no preferences are stored, or a category key is absent, the category
      is **delivered by default** (safe opt-in). An owner only stops receiving a
      category by explicitly opting out.
    - Filtering is applied **before pagination**, so `total` reflects the count
      of notifications the owner can actually see — not the raw derived count.
- **Response**:
    - `200 OK`: Paginated, preference-filtered feed.
    - `400 Bad Request`: `ownerAddress` is missing, or pagination params are out of range.
    - `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.

### Example

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/notifications?ownerAddress=0x123&page=1&pageSize=10'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
        "ownerAddress": "0x123",
        "title": "Commitment Nearing Expiry",
        "message": "Your commitment CMT-1 for XLM expires in 5 days.",
        "severity": "warning",
        "type": "expiry",
        "read": false,
        "createdAt": "2026-02-25T00:00:00.000Z",
        "relatedCommitmentId": "CMT-1"
      }
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

## `GET /api/commitments/[id]/events`

Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream that pushes real-time commitment status updates and transitions (Active, Settled, Early Exit, Violated).

- **Path parameter**: `id` (string)
- **Headers**:
    - `Accept`: `text/event-stream` (required)
- **Security**: Requires an authenticated session via browser cookies.
- **Protocol Details**:
    - **Snapshot**: The server emits a `snapshot` event immediately upon connection carrying the current status.
    - **Transitions**: The server emits a `status_change` event only when a status transition is detected on-chain.
    - **Heartbeat**: The server enqueues a comment heartbeat (`: keepalive`) every 20 seconds to prevent intermediates (proxies, load balancers) from dropping the idle connection.

### Example Event Output

```text
event: snapshot
data: {"commitmentId":"abc123","status":"Active","timestamp":"2026-05-27T01:30:00.000Z"}

: keepalive

event: status_change
data: {"commitmentId":"abc123","status":"Settled","timestamp":"2026-05-27T01:30:15.000Z"}
```

### Client Reconnection & Backoff Guidelines

- **Automatic Reconnection**: Standard browser `EventSource` handles connection drops and reconnection attempts automatically.
- **Exponential Backoff**: For non-browser clients or custom connection wrappers, implement exponential backoff on reconnection failures:
  1. Start with an initial delay of `1 second`.
  2. Double the delay on each consecutive failure (`2s`, `4s`, `8s`, `16s`).
  3. Cap the maximum delay at `30 seconds` to protect server resources.
- **Graceful Fallback**: When SSE is unsupported or fails repeatedly, clients should fall back to polling the lightweight `/api/commitments/[id]/status` route at a standard, low-frequency interval (e.g., every 10–30 seconds).

---

## `GET /api/metrics`

Simple health/metrics endpoint used by monitoring tools.

- **Response**: JSON object containing uptime, mock request/error counts, and
  current timestamp.
