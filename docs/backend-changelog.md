# Backend API Changelog

This document tracks **breaking backend API changes** that may impact this frontend. Keep entries brief, actionable, and linked to implementation artifacts.

## Purpose

- Provide a single source of truth for backend API breaking changes.
- Help frontend engineers plan migrations before backend deploys.
- Record rollout status and required frontend action.

## When to Add an Entry

Add an entry when any backend change can break existing clients, including:

- Endpoint path or HTTP method changes.
- Required request field changes (rename, type change, removal).
- Response contract changes (field removal/rename/type change).
- Auth, permission, or signature requirements that invalidate prior calls.
- Error code/shape changes relied on by clients.

## Process (Lightweight)

1. Open a changelog entry **in the same PR** as the backend breaking change.
2. Mark `Status` as `Planned`, then update to `Released` when deployed.
3. Link migration notes and owning team.
4. Frontend owner updates `Frontend Impact` and marks `Frontend Ready`.

## Entry Template

## 2026-02-25 — Backend API changelog process introduced

- **Status:** Released
- **Effective Date:** 2026-02-25
- **API Surface:** Process / Documentation
- **Change Type:** Breaking-change governance
- **Owner:** Frontend + Backend maintainers
- **Tracking:** docs/backend-changelog.md

### What Changed

- Added a dedicated process for recording backend API breaking changes.
- Standardized a single entry template for migration planning.

### Frontend Impact

- None to runtime behavior.
- Future breaking backend updates now require this document to be updated.

### Required Frontend Action

- [x] Add changelog process documentation.
- [ ] Enforce changelog updates in backend PR template (follow-up).

### Migration Notes

- This is a non-runtime governance entry that establishes the baseline process.

## 2026-02-25 — Initial baseline: no pending breaking backend changes

- **Status:** Released
- **Effective Date:** 2026-02-25
- **API Surface:** Existing documented frontend-consumed APIs
- **Change Type:** Baseline
- **Owner:** Frontend + Backend maintainers
- **Tracking:** docs/backend-changelog.md

### What Changed

- Recorded the starting point for changelog adoption.

### Frontend Impact

- No known pending breaking changes at the time of baseline creation.

### Required Frontend Action

- [x] Use this baseline as reference for all future breaking-change entries.

### Migration Notes

- First true backend contract break after this date must be added as a new dated entry.

## 2026-05-28 — Compliance score scaling consistency fix

- **Status:** Released
- **Effective Date:** 2026-05-28
- **API Surface:** Contracts service (src/lib/backend/services/contracts.ts)
- **Change Type:** Bug fix (data consistency)
- **Owner:** Frontend team
- **Tracking:** Internal issue

### What Changed

- Fixed compliance score scaling asymmetry in the contracts service
- Previously: `recordAttestationOnChain` divided scores by 100 before sending on-chain, but `parseChainCommitment` and `parseAttestationResult` did not re-scale when reading back
- Now: Both write and read paths consistently use ANALYTICS_SCALE (100) for scaling
- Added comprehensive documentation for the ANALYTICS_SCALE constant
- Added round-trip scaling tests covering boundary values (0, 50, 100)

### Frontend Impact

- Compliance scores displayed to users will now show correct values (e.g., 85 instead of 0.85)
- Previously corrupted scores from blockchain reads will now display correctly
- No API contract changes - this is an internal implementation fix

### Required Frontend Action

- [x] Fix scaling in parseChainCommitment (multiply by ANALYTICS_SCALE)
- [x] Fix scaling in parseAttestationResult (multiply by ANALYTICS_SCALE)
- [x] Add documentation for ANALYTICS_SCALE constant
- [x] Add round-trip scaling tests with boundary values

### Migration Notes

- This fix corrects a data consistency bug where compliance scores were incorrectly displayed
- The scaling convention is now: divide by 100 on write, multiply by 100 on read
- Example: Score 85 → 0.85 on-chain → 85 in application (correct round-trip)
- Tests verify no float precision loss for typical scores (0, 25, 50, 75, 85, 92, 100)
