/*
 * Cache adapter module for Commitlabs backend.
 *
 * Two adapters ship with this module:
 *   - MemoryAdapter  default for NODE_ENV=test|development. Zero dependencies,
 *                    TTL enforced on read, safe to use across test runs.
 *   - RedisAdapter   used when NODE_ENV=production and REDIS_URL is set (or when
 *                    CACHE_ADAPTER=redis is explicitly set). Requires ioredis:
 *                    `npm install ioredis`
 *
 * The active adapter is selected in factory.ts at module load time. To override
 * the default selection set CACHE_ADAPTER=redis|memory in your environment.
 *
 * All keys are namespaced under "commitlabs:" to avoid collisions with other
 * tenants sharing the same Redis instance.
